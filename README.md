# From Individual Agents to Social Beings
## A Community Network Extension of the *Flee3* Framework for the Rohingya Exodus

**Abstract:**
This study extends the *Flee3* agent-based modelling framework to simulate the 2017 Rohingya refugee crisis, focusing on how social and community networks shape patterns of displacement. Building on conflict triggers and demographic distributions, we introduce a religion-based social network extension and a novel metric of transition probability to capture sequential movement from IDP camps to Cox’s Bazar. Using empirical data from UNHCR, IOM, ISCG, and ACLED, we compare three configurations: the baseline *Flee3* model, a demographic-informed variant, and a network-augmented variant. Results show that while Cox’s Bazar consistently emerges as the dominant destination across all models, demographic and network extensions provide only marginal improvements in predictive accuracy and clustering realism. Transition probabilities remain stable at approximately 0.178 across configurations, suggesting robustness of aggregate flows to behavioural extensions under short simulation horizons. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of incorporating social networks into forced migration modelling, with implications for advancing computational migration theory and supporting humanitarian planning.

## Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes data related to the Rohingya refugee crisis. It aims to provide insights into the patterns, challenges, and outcomes of the displacement.

## Project Structure
- **results/** contains data files generated by Flee3 and FabFlee simulation softwares.
- **scripts/** includes scripts for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **plots/** stores the outputs of the analysis, including charts, graphs, and reports.

## Results
The data files created as a result of the analysis are available in the `plots/data/` folder. The plots generated from this data and from the `results/` folder can be found in the `plots/png/` folder.

## How to Use
1. Configure and run desired simulation scenarios using Flee3 and FabFlee. Edit the job file (`run_multiple_simulation.sh`) as needed and get multiple runs of the chosen conflict scenarios.
2. Navigate to this project directory, and copy over all folder generated in `FabSim3/results/` to the `results/` folder.
3. Run the scripts in the `scripts/` folder to reproduce the analysis, or add your own scripts here.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`). These also include libraries required to run Flee3 and FabFlee.
